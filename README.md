# 📖 Easy Bank <a name="setting Up a linters"></a>


**Easy Bank** Hello! My name is Abdul and this is my Capstone project for the first Module.
EasyBank is a revolutionary mobile application designed to empower individuals worldwide, regardless of their access to traditional banking services. In a world where not everyone has access to a bank account or a credit card, EasyBank aims to bridge the financial gap by leveraging the ubiquity of mobile phones.

With EasyBank, anyone with a mobile phone, even in remote villages, can gain access to a range of financial services and enjoy the benefits of a digital banking experience. The app introduces its own digital currency called TidCoin which is designed to be easy to use, secure, and accessible to all. (Warning: TidCoin is just my imagination and idea, this algorithm does not really implemented yet).

By leveraging the widespread availability of mobile phones, EasyBank aims to improve financial inclusivity and empower individuals around the world. The app provides a reliable and accessible platform for managing money, making transactions, and participating in the digital economy, ultimately contributing to the economic empowerment of individuals and communities globally.
